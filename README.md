# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to map earthquakes as well as tectonic plates.  We used Leaflet to create three base maps of the globe (a streets view, a satellite view and a dark view).  We then created three overlays.  The first overlay showed all earthquakes from the past week and used colored circles and changes in their radius to indicate the earthquakes' severity.  The second overlay displayed the tectonic plates, where many earthquakes occur.  The third overlay focused on major earthquakes (those whose magnitude was greater than 5).  The user may select any of the base maps and any combination of the overlays to view the data plotted.  The user may also click on any circle to see the corresponding earthquake's magnitude and location.
